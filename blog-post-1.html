        <h1 class="blog-post-title">Offered PhD Position in Cairns</h1>
        
        <div class="blog-post-meta">
            <span>📅 28 November 2025</span>
            <span>📍 Melbourne, Victoria</span>
            <span>👥 Lana Austin, Dianne Gleeson (optional)</span>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-post-content">
            <p>"PhDs ruin lives" That's the lesson from one of the most inspiring people I have ever met, Lana Austin. I saw her PhD threaten her to her very core. Lana is an extreme high-achieving, ecologist. 
I watched, I listened, I learned. I resolved I would not do a PhD. I'm too old. I'm not smart enough. I'm too tired. I don't code well enough. I'm too fat. I have no money. What about Smith?</p>

            <p>Surprise! The perfect PhD presented itself - I did not go looking, but there it was being sent to me by a colleague. I had a quick read. and I knew I had no choice but to apply. I mean, I can always 
deceide later right? No, I don't want to do a PhD, but I might want to do THIS PhD. This is me to a T. This PhD follows naturally from my honours research project using eDNA to detect invasive species, but this time we are moving from the sea into 
the air!</p> 
            <p>But I want adventures!! I don't want to be stuck. Well, THIS PhD requires me to move to Cairns because it involves extensive travel around the top end of Australia. Wait, what if I can go to Cape York with this? 
I could travel all around Darwin, who knows where this will lead? I could address one of my key career goals of woking with Indigenous Australians. I will develop my skills in communicating complex concepts to a wide audience. 
I will develop my molecular skills to answer important questions and I will be doing real research which will benefit Australias biosecurity, something I am very passionate about. It's not WILL I do this? it's how could I not? OMG guys. I interviewed for this thing and guess what? </p>

<p> The interview was incredible. I interveiwed better than I have before. I was all over it and everyone knew that. I know the science and I understand the space. They offered me this very competitive PhD same day. They loved me! and I loved them they seem like really thoughtful, considerate, compassionate and caring people and I would be thrilled to have them as my supervisors.</p>

            <h3>Reality Sets In</h3>
            
            <p>So here I am yet again, unemployed, and waiting for a massive, major life change. What is going to happen when I go there? I have been working on trying to find a place to live, and in doing so, I have come to learn some things I hadn't 
                realised about Cairns culture. Look, I'll be just fine as long as I don't let on I am from Victoria!! No, I AM indeed shitting myself, but at the same time, I am super excited. Standing up and facing into the unknown depsite knowing it will definitely break me,.... but 
                it might not. I might just actually succeed. All of this, all of this resilience training might actually be leading me somewhere I want to be.</p>

            <img src="blog-1-photo-2.png" alt="Description of photo">
            <p class="image-caption">Lana, Louis and me</p>

            <p>But there are so many things - I keep thinking about my bed - I finally have an amazing bed. after years of struggle. I need it!! My dining table - back into storage yet again - what will happen to it THIS time? last time, it turned black and developed a massive split down the centre. 
            It's a miracle I managed to get the bowe out of it. I dream of this table being in Smiths home one day. I dream about Smith refinishing it. Or maybe we do that together. I think about Louis finding safety underneath this table. resting hiis head on the cold, steel bars
            that I taught myself to weld with an old arc welder I rescued from the Echuca tip. The biggest, hardest part. Louis the dog. Louis can't come with me. I will be doing a lot of travel. There are simply too many unknowns. He can't come and that kills me. 
            But thankfully he has Lana. Lana loves him and is better with him even than I am. He loves her so much. I know he will be safe. I know that for sure. That is something I am very grateful for. Lana is a wonderful human and I am lucky to know her, </p>
